+ main.py --> This will be the entry point of the application.

+ models/: Here we will place the classes that represent the different components of the simulator (users, market, transactions).
    - user.py --> We will represent users, including their portfolios and available capital.
    - market.py --> We will represent the market with a set of available stocks.
    - transaction.py --> We will define how a purchase or sale of shares is recorded.
    - database.py --> DB actions


+ services/: Here we will manage the market logic and other application operations.
    - market_service.py --> We will create functions that simulate the fluctuation of stock prices.
                            We will implement a method to get the current price of a stock.

+ data/: We can use it to store configuration files or temporary data.

+ tests/: Here we will put our unit tests as we go along.
